### Objective
Using the raw data set, Census Income Data Set, from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository the goal of this project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year. 

### Method 
In EDA, we use the MissForest algorithm to impute missing values as it decreases computational time. 
Next, we dummified our data because some built-in R functions are unable to deal with multiple categorical variables. Based on our binning we have 26 predictors after dummifying. Even though random forests should be able to handle categorical values natively, we look for a different implementation so we donâ€™t have to encode all of the features and use up all our memory. Some other algorithms (notably tree()) can only work with 32 factors.
Finally, we visualize the entire dataset using k-Means clustering.
Once EDA is complete, we fit the following classification models: classfication trees, bagged trees, and random forests. Then we measured model performance using a confusion matrix, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and its corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) value.
